    <p>
      My name is Ovinson, I'm from Dominican Republic and I've liked
      technology since I was a kid. I like to eat all types of food and I
      enjoy being with my family. I also like basketball, one of my favorite players are Lebron James, Kyrey Irving, and
      Anthony Edwards. I like playing Call of Duty Warzone with my friends but if I'm alone I just play multiplayer and
      complete challenges. If I had the time I would spend time outside playing basketball and riding bikes and doing
      some exercise. I want to be a software engineer and be able to support
      my family in a better way. Right now my wife is working and this is helping me a lot to focus on school. I'm glad
      to be taking this course and I'm willing to learn as much as possible. I have many goals in my life and one of
      them is helping others in some way and in order for me to do that I need connections and money. I would like to
      help
      young people to have more study opportunitties and I know that by doing this they world is gonna change for the
      better,
      maybe not suddenly but in the long-term I know it will.
