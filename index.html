      <p>
        My name is Ovinson, I'm from Dominican Republic and I've liked
        technology since I was a kid. I like to eat all types of food and I
        enjoy being with my family. I also like basketball, and playing Call of
        Duty sometimes. I want to be a software engineer and be able to support
        my family, and people who are in need. I'm glad to be taking this course
        and I'm willing to learn as much as possible.
