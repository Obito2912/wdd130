      <p class="text">
        My name is Ovinson, I'm from Dominican Republic and I've liked
        technology since I was a kid. I like to eat all types of food and I
        enjoy being with my family. I also like basketball, one of my favorite players are Lebron James, Kyrey Irving,
        and
        Anthony Edwards. I like playing Call of Duty Warzone with my friends but if I'm alone I just play multiplayer
        and
        complete challenges. If I had the time I would spend time outside playing basketball and riding bikes and doing
        some exercise. I want to be a software engineer and be able to support
        my family in a better way. Right now my wife is working and this is helping me a lot to focus on school. I'm
        glad
        to be taking this course and I'm willing to learn as much as possible. I have many goals in my life and one of
        them is helping others in some way and in order for me to do that I need connections and money. I would like to
        help
        young people to have more study opportunities and I know that by doing this they world is gonna change for the
        better,
        maybe not suddenly but in the long-term I know it will.
